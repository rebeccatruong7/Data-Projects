I keep the code for my data projects in this repository!

**Hong Kong International Airport (HKG) Code Walkthrough**   
I used Python to create the data visualizations in ["Government Policies Have Dimmed the Pearl of the East"](https://medium.com/@rebecca.truong).

**Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Query**
I used SQL to clean a dataset containing pricing on Nashville Housing units.
