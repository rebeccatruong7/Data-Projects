# Data-Projects
I keep the code for my data projects in this repository!

[**Hong Kong International Airport (HKG) Code Walkthrough](https://github.com/rebeccatruong7/Data-Projects/blob/main/HKG%20Code%20Walkthrough.ipynb)**   
I used Python to create the data visualizations in ["Government Policies Have Dimmed the Pearl of the East"](https://medium.com/@rebecca.truong).

**Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Query**   
I used SQL to clean a dataset containing pricing on Nashville Housing units.

**Movie Correlation Project**   
I used Python to analyze the top 100 movies on IMDB. 

**Excel Project Bike Buyers**   
I used Excel to analyze a dataset on bike rentals in New York City and created an interactive dashboard.
